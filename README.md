# Orangutan Detector Balik Kampoeng 2024
Part of Balik Kampoeng 2024 initiatives on installing Trap Camera IoT device for Ranger Patrol team of Yayasan Masyarakat Batas Leuser (YMB) in Bukit Lawang, North Sumatra. 
Working with open source Orangutan image datasets, our goal is to develop object detection model using Yolov7. Existing similar model can be found out there, and will be used as benchmark for the measurements of overall model performances.

## Background Story
Conflicts among Orangutan and civilians in the residential areas that lies within the borderline of Gunung Leuser National Park is inevitable and has been occurring until now. Often times, orangutan gets threatened with violence by human everytime they entered the residential land and damaged their crops. Since then, Ranger Patrol team, who is consisted of 12 people from Yayasan Masyarakan Batas Leuser (YMB), has been patroling 500 km long to monitor the activities of Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo Abeii) and other endangered species such as Rhinos, Elephants, and Sumatran Tigers. We are inspired by their great effort in preserving the ecological balance between humans and Orangutans, and through Balik Kampoeng, we'd like to assist their effort by providing technology for detecting orangutan intrusions.
